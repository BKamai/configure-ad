<h1>On-premises Active Directory Deployed in the Cloud (Azure)</h1>
The purpose of this project is to explain the process of setting up Active Directory using the Azure platform including connection to an endpoint and user creation.<br />




<h2>Environments and Technologies Used</h2>

- Microsoft Azure (Virtual Machines/Compute)
- Remote Desktop
- Remote Desktop and a laptop that is capable of  using Remote Desktop Protocol
- PowerShell

<h2>Operating Systems Used </h2>

- Windows Server 2019
- Windows 11 (23H2)

<h2>High-Level Deployment and Configuration Steps</h2>

- Setup Resources in Azure
- Ensure Connectivity between the client and Domain Controller
- Install Active Directory & Promotion To Domain Controller
- Create an Admin and Normal User Account in AD
- Join Client-1 to your domain (mydomain.com)
- Setup Remote Desktop for non-administrative users on Client-1
- Create an additional users and attempt to log into client-1 with one of the users


<h2>Prerequisites</h2>

- Microsoft Azure Subscription
- Creation of the following
	- Resource Group
	- Virtual Machines (Windows Server 2019 & Windows 11 Pro
	- Virtual Networks & Subnets
- Both Virtual Machines are to be set up under the same virtual network


<h2>Deployment and Configuration Steps</h2>

<h3>Step 2 - Ensure Connectivity between the client and Domain Controller</h3>

Required

-Public IP address and private IP address of the both server and client

-Server IP addresses

Select the Virtual Machine DC-01

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c04f1b8b-f1c0-4893-bf51-c914680cc8a7)

Client IP Addresses
Select the Virtual Machine CL-01

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a8dfbe34-18f2-4914-a44d-88b2094f795a)



Using the remote desktop tool, log into both client and server

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/35a5c4ae-9149-4812-a653-439cebee7e55)

Connection to server completed

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1c32a715-2f21-4465-9339-c79acac08f9d)

Connection to Client via remote desktop

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1c65a629-4880-4f35-81d2-bdeffe08c2c2)

Login to Client-1 with Remote Desktop and ping DC-1â€™s private IP address with ping -t <ip address> (perpetual ping)

To enter the  Windows Powershell (Admin), right click on the start button and select Windows Powershell (Admin)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8724f309-4fd9-42df-96d8-4a92f8eee00f)

Pinging the client CL-01  private ip address with a pepetual ping
- ping -t 10.0.0.5

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3552d66c-5ac6-4612-90e4-8bbe4bb64633)

Ping unsuccessful due to ICMPv4 protocol being deactivated

Login to the Domain Controller and enable ICMPv4 in on the local windows Firewall, repeat on the client as well

Sort protocol by ICMP and view the Core Networking Diagnostics highlighted below

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/acfb0c92-5b8c-4690-ba18-94b8b1a0b224)
